Collaborations online are most common when people know what they want and know how the work flow works:

many ways to achieve a song:
straight from 0
from inspiration
improvisation
adehering to theory bases
mathematically

Depending on the specific request a price and a schedule can be set. starting by setting up the foundation and sharing individual tracks. maintaining versions and backups and bouncing the tracks and having a list of track pprocesses so the plugins that are not mutual can be taken care of and accounted for and get them in the final mix

have this aditive back and forward communication untils a mix is achieved once a mix is achieved  with all tracks polished as will be, start Mastering.

Once decent levels on all formats iis achieved start the distribution, marketing part of the song or end of the deal
